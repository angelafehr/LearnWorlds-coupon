## Additional Ways to Save on LearnWorlds

### 1. Annual Billing

Opting for annual billing instead of monthly payments typically reduces the overall cost by up to **20%**.

For example, if a monthly plan **costs $100**, the annual plan might be priced at **$960** instead of **$1,200,** effectively giving you two months free.

This discount is built into LearnWorlds’ pricing structure to incentivize longer-term commitments, making it a reliable way to save if you’re confident in using the platform for a year.

### 2. Seasonal Deals

LearnWorlds often runs promotions during major holidays or events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or their own anniversary sales.

These deals can include percentage discounts (e.g., **25-50% off specific plans**), extended free trials, or free add-ons.

To take advantage, monitor their official website, email newsletters, or social media channels around November (for Black Friday) or other key dates.

These offers are time-limited, so acting quickly is key.

### 3. LearnWorlds Non-Profit Discounts

Non-profit organizations may qualify for special pricing, though exact details (e.g., discount percentage) aren’t always publicized.

You need to contact LearnWorlds’ support team directly, usually via email or their website’s contact form, and provide proof of non-profit status (e.g., 501(c)(3) documentation in the U.S.).

If approved, the discount could significantly lower costs, tailored to your organization’s needs.

LearnWorlds typically offers a **30-day free trial** for new users.
